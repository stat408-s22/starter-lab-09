# Lab 09 - Predictive modeling

_Due Wednesday May 4 by 5:00pm_

Work through Lab 09 at: [https://stat408-s22.github.io/labs/lab-09/lab-09-predictive-modeling.html](https://stat408-s22.github.io/labs/lab-09/lab-09-predictive-modeling.html) (also linked off of our [course calendar webpage](https://stat408-s22.github.io/calendar.html)). 

You will work on this lab in teams. 
The lab will guide you through cloning your team's Lab 09 repo (named `lab-09-predictive-modeling-YOUR_TEAM_NAME`) from our [GitHub stat408-s22 organization](https://github.com/stat408-s22), adding your lab answers to the starter `lab-09.Rmd` file in your repo, knitting to a pdf file, then pushing your changes to GitHub. Your team's final answers -- .Rmd and .pdf files -- should be pushed to GitHub prior to the due date. Labs will be graded in GitHub.
